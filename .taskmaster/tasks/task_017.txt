# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement Basic Security Features
# Status: deferred
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop essential security features for the MVP.
# Details:
1. Implement secure storage of API tokens in environment variables
2. Create secure webhook signature verification
3. Add CSRF protection for forms
4. Implement basic rate limiting for API endpoints
5. Create simple logging for security-relevant actions
6. Add secure headers
7. Implement basic access controls
8. Create security documentation
9. Follow security best practices for all implementations
10. Create comprehensive unit tests for security features
11. Implement security-focused integration tests

# Test Strategy:
Implement comprehensive unit tests with Jest for all security features. Test security features with basic checks and penetration testing approaches. Verify that API tokens are properly protected and that webhook verification prevents tampering. Test CSRF protection, rate limiting, and access controls with various scenarios. Create test fixtures for different security scenarios. Aim for 90% code coverage for security-related code. Include integration tests that verify end-to-end security workflows with simulated attacks.
