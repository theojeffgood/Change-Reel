<info added on 2025-06-25T18:40:27.276Z>
**OAUTH APP REGISTRATION STEPS:**

1. **Go to GitHub Developer Settings:**
   - Navigate to https://github.com/settings/applications/new
   - Or go to Settings → Developer Settings → OAuth Apps → New OAuth App

2. **Application Details to Register:**
   - **Application name**: "Change Reel - Git Commit Changelog"
   - **Homepage URL**: Will be the production domain (TBD, use localhost for now)
   - **Authorization callback URL**: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/github/callback` (for development)
   - **Application description**: "Automated changelog generation from Git commits with AI-powered summaries"

3. **Required OAuth Scopes:**
   - `repo` - Full access to repositories (needed for webhook creation and commit access)
   - `write:repo_hook` - Write access to repository hooks (for webhook management)
   - `user:email` - Access to user email (for notifications)

4. **Environment Variables Needed:**
   ```
   GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
   GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_random_secret_here
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

**NEXT STEPS:**
- Register the OAuth app with the above configuration
- Note down the Client ID and Client Secret
- Set up environment variables
- Configure callback URL for production deployment later

**CALLBACK URL CORRECTION**

⚠️ **IMPORTANT URL PATTERN CORRECTION**

The callback URL pattern for NextAuth.js differs from what was initially configured:

- ❌ **Incorrect pattern used**: `/api/auth/github/callback`
- ✅ **Correct pattern required**: `/api/auth/callback/github`

**Updated Authorization callback URLs:**
- Development: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github`
- Production: `https://yourdomain.com/api/auth/callback/github` (when ready)

**Steps to fix:**
1. Go to GitHub Developer Settings → OAuth Apps → Change Reel
2. Edit the "Authorization callback URL" field
3. Update to the correct pattern: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github`
4. Save changes

This corrects the "redirect_uri is not associated with this application" error that occurs during OAuth flow.

**NextAuth.js URL Structure Reference:**
- Sign-in: `/api/auth/signin/github`
- Callback: `/api/auth/callback/github`
- Session: `/api/auth/session`
