# Task ID: 18
# Title: Create Docker Deployment Configuration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop basic Docker configuration for containerizing the Next.js application for local development and production deployment.
# Details:
1. Create Dockerfile for the Next.js application
2. Implement docker-compose for local development (app only, no database services)
3. Optimize Docker image for production deployment
4. Create basic deployment scripts for production
5. Implement environment variable management for containers
6. Add health checks for the application
7. Create basic tests for Docker configuration

**Key Simplifications:**
- Removed Redis references (app doesn't use Redis)
- Removed database services (uses third-party Supabase)
- Removed staging/dev environments (only local and production)
- Simplified scope to focus on containerizing the Next.js app only
- Removed complex backup/restore procedures
- Removed multi-service orchestration complexity

**Major Progress Update:**
Completed 4 out of 7 original subtasks. While the implementation included more complex features than needed, the core Docker functionality is ready:
- Multi-stage production Dockerfile with security optimizations
- Docker-compose configurations (can be simplified to remove database/Redis)
- Production optimization with security scanning and size reduction
- AWS EC2 deployment automation
- Basic health checks and environment variable templates already in place

# Test Strategy:
Test Docker build and run locally. Verify the containerized Next.js application starts correctly and responds to health checks. Test environment variable loading. Validate production image optimization. Test basic deployment to production environment.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Dockerfile [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop Dockerfile for the application
### Details:

<info added on 2025-07-24T18:22:40.261Z>
Port configuration updated to use 3001:

- Modified EXPOSE directive from 3000 to 3001
- Updated HEALTHCHECK command to check localhost:3001/api/health
- Changed ENV PORT=3001 to ensure Next.js runs on the correct port
- Updated test-docker.sh script to use port 3001 for container port mapping and health checks
- Modified all port references throughout the Dockerfile and related scripts

This change accommodates the EC2 instance configuration where nginx reverse proxy routes traffic to different applications, allowing this application to run on port 3001 while another service uses port 3000.

**Files Created:**
1. `docker-compose.yml` - Development configuration with local PostgreSQL and Redis
2. `docker-compose.prod.yml` - Production configuration with resource limits and Nginx
3. `nginx.conf` - Production-ready Nginx reverse proxy with SSL, rate limiting, and security headers
4. `docker.env.template` - Environment variable template for Docker setup
5. `scripts/test-docker-compose.sh` - Comprehensive test suite for both dev and prod environments

**Key Features:**
- Multi-environment support (development vs production)
- Health checks for all services
- Volume persistence for data
- Network isolation
- Resource limits in production
- Comprehensive logging configuration
- Security headers and SSL termination

**Simplification Update:**

The docker-compose configuration has been simplified to focus on single-service deployment for the Next.js application only. 

**Changes Made:**
- Removed PostgreSQL service from docker-compose.yml (app uses external Supabase)
- Removed Redis service and all Redis-related configuration
- Simplified docker-compose.yml to contain only the Next.js service
- Updated environment configuration to focus on Supabase connection variables
- Removed multi-service orchestration complexity
- Simplified test scripts to validate single-service setup
- Removed Nginx service from production configuration (can use platform-provided reverse proxy)

**New Simplified Structure:**
- `docker-compose.yml` - Single Next.js service for local development
- `docker.env.template` - Simplified environment template with Supabase variables only
- `scripts/test-docker-compose.sh` - Updated to test single-service deployment

The configuration now aligns with the application's actual architecture, using external Supabase for database needs and no Redis dependency.

<info added on 2025-07-24T18:20:04.030Z>
**Important Clarification:** Even during local development, the application connects to the same production database (Supabase). There is no separate local database.

**Updated Docker Compose Configuration:**
- `docker-compose.yml` should only contain the Next.js application service
- No database services needed at all (not even for local development)
- Environment variables point to the same Supabase instance for both local and production
- The only differences between local and production environments are:
  - Local runs the container on localhost
  - Production runs on deployed infrastructure
  - Possibly different OAuth callback URLs for local vs production domains

**Simplified Architecture:**
- Single Next.js service in docker-compose
- All environments connect to the same external Supabase database
- No local database setup or data persistence volumes needed
- Environment configuration focuses only on app settings, not database connections

This makes the Docker setup much simpler since there's no database service management needed at any level.

<info added on 2025-07-24T18:22:58.897Z>
**Port Configuration Update Completed:**

Updated docker-compose.yml to use port 3001 instead of 3000 for the Next.js application service. The container now maps internal port 3001 to host port 3001.

**Changes Applied:**
- Modified port mapping in docker-compose.yml from "3000:3000" to "3001:3001"
- Updated test-docker-compose.sh script to validate endpoints on http://localhost:3001
- Modified docker.env.template to reference port 3001 for local development URLs
- Updated health check configuration to use port 3001

**Local Development Access:**
- Application now accessible at http://localhost:3001 during local development
- Avoids conflicts with other services commonly running on port 3000
- OAuth callback URLs for local development should be configured to use localhost:3001

The port change maintains consistency across all Docker-related configuration files and test scripts.

## 5. Implement environment variable management [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create system for managing environment variables
### Details:
Implement secure variable management with validation. Build upon existing docker.env.template and deployment scripts to create a comprehensive environment variable management system. Include:
- Centralized environment variable validation
- Secure storage and retrieval mechanisms
- Integration with existing Docker and EC2 deployment scripts
- Support for multiple environments (dev, staging, production)
- Documentation for all required variables
<info added on 2025-07-24T18:12:13.973Z>
**Updated Goal:** Create simplified environment variable management for only two environments: local development and production.

**Simplified Scope:**
- Remove staging/dev environment references (only local and production needed)
- Focus on environment variables for Next.js app and Supabase connection
- Remove complex multi-environment validation since only two environments exist
- Simplify variable management to essential app configuration only

**Environment Variables Needed:**
- Next.js configuration variables
- Supabase connection variables (URL, anon key, service role key)
- Authentication provider keys (GitHub OAuth)
- Basic application configuration

Remove the complexity around multiple staging environments since this project only uses local and production.
</info added on 2025-07-24T18:12:13.973Z>
<info added on 2025-07-24T18:20:29.785Z>
**Updated Environment Variable Management Strategy:**

Both local development and production environments connect to the same Supabase database instance, which significantly simplifies our environment variable management approach.

**Revised Variable Categories:**

1. **Shared Database Connection Variables** (identical for both environments):
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL - Same Supabase project URL for local and production
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY - Same anonymous key for client-side access
   - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY - Same service role key for server-side operations

2. **Environment-Specific OAuth Configuration:**
   - GITHUB_CLIENT_ID - Can be same or different OAuth app for local/prod
   - GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET - Corresponding secret for the OAuth app
   - NEXTAUTH_URL - Must differ: http://localhost:3000 for local, production domain for prod
   - NEXTAUTH_SECRET - Different secrets recommended for each environment

3. **Application Configuration Variables:**
   - NODE_ENV - Set to 'development' or 'production'
   - Feature flags or environment-specific settings as needed

**Implementation Implications:**
- Single .env file can contain most variables since database config is shared
- Only OAuth callback URLs and NextAuth configuration require environment-specific values
- Reduces complexity in deployment scripts and Docker configuration
- Simplifies secret management since fewer unique values per environment

<info added on 2025-07-24T18:25:31.762Z>
**Port Configuration Update for Local Development:**

All local development references must use port 3001 instead of 3000 to match the application's actual configuration.

**NEXTAUTH_URL Updates:**
- Local development: `NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3001`
- Production: `NEXTAUTH_URL=https://[production-domain]` (no port specification needed)

**OAuth Callback Configuration:**
- Local GitHub OAuth callback: `http://localhost:3001/api/auth/callback/github`
- Production callback: `https://[production-domain]/api/auth/callback/github`
- GitHub OAuth app settings must be updated to include the localhost:3001 callback URL

**Required Template and Documentation Updates:**
- docker.env.template must show `NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3001` in local examples
- PORT environment variable should be set to `3001` for Next.js configuration
- All localhost references in environment examples must use port 3001
- Health check endpoints for local testing: `http://localhost:3001/api/health`

**Docker Configuration Adjustments:**
- Container port mapping should expose port 3001 for local development
- Any internal application URLs referencing localhost must use port 3001
- Development scripts should reference the correct port for local testing

## 6. Add health checks [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement health check endpoints and monitoring
### Details:
Enhance existing health check infrastructure with comprehensive monitoring. Build upon the /api/health endpoint and healthcheck.js script to add:
- Extended health checks for all services (database, Redis, external APIs)
- Detailed status reporting with response times and error rates
- Integration with CloudWatch monitoring already configured
- Dashboard for health status visualization
- Alerting mechanisms for health check failures
- Performance metrics collection
<info added on 2025-07-24T18:12:59.891Z>
**Updated Goal:** Implement basic health checks for the Next.js application only, without external service monitoring.

**Simplified Scope:**
- Remove database monitoring (app uses external Supabase)
- Remove Redis monitoring (app doesn't use Redis)
- Focus health checks on the Next.js application itself
- Basic application readiness and liveness checks
- Simple endpoint response verification

**Health Check Areas:**
- Application startup and responsiveness
- Basic API endpoint functionality
- Memory and basic resource usage
- Application configuration validation

Remove the complexity around monitoring external services since the app uses third-party database services and doesn't use Redis. Focus on containerized application health only.

<info added on 2025-07-24T18:25:54.474Z>
**Health Check Port Configuration:**
- All health check endpoints should target port 3001 instead of 3000
- Docker container health checks: HEALTHCHECK command should check localhost:3001/api/health
- External health checks from nginx or monitoring tools should target port 3001
- Local development health checks should use http://localhost:3001/api/health

**Health Check Endpoint Updates:**
- /api/health endpoint should respond on port 3001
- Any internal application health monitoring should check port 3001
- Load balancer and reverse proxy health checks should target the correct port
- Monitoring scripts should validate application availability on port 3001

**Docker Health Check Configuration:**
- Dockerfile HEALTHCHECK directive should use port 3001
- Container orchestration tools should monitor port 3001
- Health check intervals and retry logic should target the correct port

This ensures consistency with the application's actual runtime port configuration.
