ERROR INVESTIGATION SUMMARY
================================================================================

ERROR: "No diff content available for summarization"
JOB ID: 9bff89b2-be1a-4e46-8853-f3872aa21507
USER: Theo Goodman (GitHub ID: 26825549)
LOCATION: src/lib/jobs/handlers/generate-summary-handler.ts (line 95)

================================================================================
QUICK FACTS
================================================================================

1. WHAT HAPPENED:
   A job processing task failed because it couldn't find the diff content
   needed to generate an AI summary of a code commit.

2. WHY IT MATTERS:
   - No summary will be generated for this commit
   - Email notifications won't be sent
   - Changelog/release notes will be incomplete

3. ROOT CAUSE (most likely):
   The job that fetches the diff content (fetch_diff) either:
   - Never ran
   - Failed before completing
   - Completed but didn't store the diff in the expected location

4. TIME TO INVESTIGATE:
   5-10 minutes using the provided SQL queries

5. TIME TO FIX:
   2-5 minutes (once root cause is known)

RECOMMENDED INVESTIGATION FLOW
================================================================================

START HERE (5 minutes):
  └─ Use INVESTIGATION_CHECKLIST.md
     └─ Run PHASE 1-5 SQL queries

        └─ Review "Likely Root Causes" section
           └─ Match your findings to probability breakdown

IF STILL UNCLEAR (Debug deeper):
  └─ Use DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md
     └─ Run debugging TypeScript code or SQL debug queries
        └─ Check "Common Issues & Fixes" section
           └─ Apply specific fix for your scenario

================================================================================
THE ERROR OCCURS BECAUSE
================================================================================

The generate_summary job handler looks for diff content in this order:

  1. job.data.diff_content
  2. job.context.result.diff_content
  3. job.context.result.data.diff_content
  4. dependency_job.context.result.diff_content (same checks as 2-3)

When ALL FOUR locations are empty, it fails with your error.

This diff content should have been populated by the fetch_diff job that
runs BEFORE generate_summary in the job workflow.

If fetch_diff:
  ✓ Succeeded → it should have populated one of the 4 locations above
  ✗ Failed    → generate_summary can't run because no diff exists
  ? Missing   → there's no dependency relationship set up

================================================================================
MOST COMMON ROOT CAUSES (Ranked by Probability)
================================================================================

#1 - MISSING OR FAILED fetch_diff JOB (60%)
     └─ The fetch_diff job either:
        • Never created or orphaned
        • Failed with GitHub API error
        • Failed with rate limiting
        • Failed with invalid repository/branch
     └─ SQL CHECK: See INVESTIGATION_CHECKLIST.md PHASE 2

#2 - BROKEN DEPENDENCY CHAIN (20%)
     └─ The job dependency relationship is missing or malformed
     └─ SQL CHECK: See INVESTIGATION_CHECKLIST.md PHASE 2

#3 - DIFF CONTENT TOO LARGE OR INVALID (10%)
     └─ fetch_diff rejected the diff and didn't store it
     └─ SQL CHECK: Look for errors like "size limit exceeded"

#4 - CONTEXT STRUCTURE MISMATCH (10%)
     └─ Diff exists but stored under different key name
     └─ generate_summary looking in wrong place
     └─ SQL CHECK: See DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md "Issue #2"

================================================================================
FIRST SQL QUERY TO RUN (Takes 30 seconds)
================================================================================

Copy-paste this into your Supabase SQL editor to get immediate insights:

---

SELECT 
  j.id,
  j.type,
  j.status,
  j.attempts,
  j.error_message,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN jd.id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as has_dependencies,
  CASE 
    WHEN j.status = 'failed' THEN '❌ FAILED'
    WHEN j.status = 'pending' THEN '⏱️ PENDING'
    WHEN j.status = 'completed' THEN '✅ COMPLETED'
    ELSE '❓ ' || j.status
  END as status_icon
FROM jobs j
LEFT JOIN job_dependencies jd ON j.id = jd.job_id
WHERE j.id = '9bff89b2-be1a-4e46-8853-f3872aa21507'
GROUP BY j.id, j.type, j.status, j.attempts, j.error_message;

---

Expected results will show:
• status: should be 'failed'
• has_dependencies: should be 1 (if > 0, dependency exists)
• error_message: "No diff content available for summarization"

================================================================================
QUICK FIXES BY ROOT CAUSE
================================================================================

If root cause is #1 (fetch_diff failed):
  └─ UPDATE jobs SET status = 'pending', attempts = 0
     WHERE type = 'fetch_diff'::job_type
     AND commit_id = (SELECT commit_id FROM jobs WHERE id = '...');

If root cause is #2 (missing dependency):
  └─ INSERT INTO job_dependencies (job_id, depends_on_job_id)
     SELECT '9bff89b2-be1a-4e46-8853-f3872aa21507', fetch_diff_id
     WHERE ... (see INVESTIGATION_CHECKLIST.md Fix #1)

If root cause is #3 (invalid diff):
  └─ Check GitHub repository configuration
     └─ Verify repository exists and is accessible
     └─ Check GitHub token/credentials

If root cause is #4 (context mismatch):
  └─ Check src/lib/jobs/handlers/fetch-diff-handler.ts
     └─ Verify it's storing diff in context.result.diff_content

================================================================================
AFTER YOU FIX IT
================================================================================

1. Run this to reset the job:

   UPDATE jobs 
   SET status = 'pending', attempts = 0, error_message = NULL
   WHERE id = '9bff89b2-be1a-4e46-8853-f3872aa21507';

2. Wait 5 seconds for job processor to pick it up

3. Verify it completed:

   SELECT status, error_message FROM jobs 
   WHERE id = '9bff89b2-be1a-4e46-8853-f3872aa21507';

4. Check commit has summary now:

   SELECT summary FROM commits WHERE id = (
     SELECT commit_id FROM jobs 
     WHERE id = '9bff89b2-be1a-4e46-8853-f3872aa21507'
   );

================================================================================
PREVENT THIS IN THE FUTURE
================================================================================

1. Add validation that fetch_diff completed before generate_summary runs
2. Add logging to track diff_content through the job context
3. Add alerts when generate_summary fails with missing diff_content
4. Add a fallback: if diff missing, fetch from GitHub directly

See INVESTIGATION_GUIDE.md "Monitoring & Prevention" section for details.
