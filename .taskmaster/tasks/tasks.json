Token Bucket Rate Limiter (`src/lib/openai/rate-limiter.ts`):**\n- **Dual-metric limiting**: Both requests per minute AND tokens per minute\n- **Operation-specific quotas**: Different limits for summarization vs change detection\n- **Burst capability**: Configurable burst multiplier (e.g., 1.5x base rate)\n- **Memory-based storage**: In-memory bucket state with automatic refill logic\n- **Environment configuration**: Configurable via `OPENAI_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE`, `OPENAI_TOKENS_PER_MINUTE`\n\n**2. Default Rate Limits (Production Ready):**\n- **Summarization**: 100 RPM, 75K TPM (higher token usage)\n- **Change Detection**: 300 RPM, 40K TPM (lower token usage)  \n- **General**: 200 RPM, 50K TPM (balanced usage)\n- **Burst allowance**: 1.5x base rates for handling traffic spikes\n\n**3. OpenAI Client Integration:**\n- **Pre-call rate checking**: Estimates tokens before API calls\n- **Graceful degradation**: Change detection falls back to rule-based when rate limited\n- **Clear error messages**: Detailed rate limit exceeded errors with retry times\n- **No API waste**: Prevents calling OpenAI when rate limited\n\n**4. Comprehensive Rate Limiting Features:**\n- **Token estimation**: Smart approximation (prompt + response tokens / 3)\n- **Real-time status**: `getStatus()` for monitoring remaining quotas\n- **Manual reset**: `reset()` for testing and admin operations\n- **Helper utilities**: `waitForRateLimit()` and `withRateLimit()` wrapper\n- **Environment detection**: Auto-configures based on deployment tier\n\n**5. Advanced Configuration:**\n- **Partial config support**: Can override specific limits per operation type\n- **Factory pattern**: `createRateLimiter()` with environment variable support\n- **Per-operation customization**: Different quotas for different use cases\n- **Development-friendly**: Lower limits for testing, higher for production\n\n**6. Testing & Validation:**\n- **30 comprehensive tests** covering all functionality\n- **Mock rate limiter** for unit testing other components  \n- **Edge case handling**: Rapid calls, burst scenarios, token depletion\n- **Integration tests** with OpenAI client showing graceful fallbacks\n\n**7.

No more manual API calls needed!\n</info added on 2025-07-22T19:44:52.725Z>",

Component Responsibilities & Interfaces (excerpt)\n| Component | Props | Description |\n|-----------|-------|-------------|\n| AdminLayout | { children } | Shell with header/nav; wraps ErrorBoundary |\n| RepositoryConfigPanel | none | Shows repo name, visibility, webhook status via hook |\n| CommitList | { commits: Commit[] } | Efficiently renders commit cards (react-window) |\n| LoadingSpinner | { size?: 'sm'|'md'|'lg' } | Tailwind animated spinner |\n| ErrorBoundary | React error boundary with fallback UI |\n\n### 3. Shared Type\n```\nexport interface Commit {\n  id: string;\n  sha: string;\n  author: string;\n  summary: string;\n  type: 'feature' | 'fix' | 'refactor' | 'chore';\n  timestamp: string;\n}\n```\n\n### 4. State Management\nReact Context (`AdminUIContext`) stores filters (dateRange, changeTypes[]) and pagination ({ page, pageSize }). Provider lives in AdminLayout.\n\n### 5. Data Fetching Strategy\nSWR or custom fetcher. Hooks return { data, isLoading, error } enabling LoadingSpinner & ErrorBoundary.\n\n### 6. Testing Considerations\nPure presentational components, hooks mocked in tests, ErrorBoundary exposes onError for assertions.\n\n### 7. Implementation Order\n1. Scaffold directories & placeholder components (task branch).\n2. Implement RepositoryConfigPanel (Subtask 10.2).\n3. Commit history list & filters (10.3–10.4).\n4. Hooks & context (10.5–10.6).\n5. Loading/error wrappers (10.8).\n6. Unit tests (10.9) then integration tests (10.10).\n</info added on 2025-06-27T22:28:28.756Z>",

Go to GitHub Developer Settings → OAuth Apps → Change Reel\n2. Edit the \"Authorization callback URL\" field\n3. Update to the correct pattern: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github`\n4.
