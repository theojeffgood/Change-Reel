# Task ID: 19
# Title: Implement Performance Optimizations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6, 7, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize application performance to meet the non-functional requirement of webhook-to-summary latency < 10s.
# Details:
1. Implement efficient caching for database operations
2. Optimize database queries and indexes
3. Add efficient job processing
4. Optimize OpenAI API usage with prompt engineering
5. Add basic performance monitoring
6. Implement lazy loading for UI components
7. Create performance testing tools
8. Document performance optimization strategies
9. Follow performance best practices for all implementations
10. Create comprehensive performance tests
11. Implement performance benchmarking

# Test Strategy:
Implement comprehensive performance tests with appropriate benchmarking tools. Conduct performance testing with simulated load. Measure webhook-to-summary latency and optimize until it consistently meets the < 10s requirement. Test caching effectiveness, database query performance, and API response times. Create test fixtures for performance testing. Implement automated performance regression testing. Document performance test results and optimization impacts.
