# Details:
1. Set up OpenAI API client with proper authentication
2. Implement the prompt template as specified in the PRD appendix
3. Create a service to process diffs and send them to OpenAI
4. Parse and store the generated summaries in the Supabase database
5. Implement detection of change types (feature, fix, refactor, chore)
6. Add error handling and retry logic for API failures
7. Implement rate limiting to manage API costs
8. Create a simple job system for processing summaries sequentially
9. Follow dependency injection pattern for OpenAI service
10. Create comprehensive unit tests with mocked OpenAI API responses
11. Implement integration tests for OpenAI API interactions

# Test Strategy:
Implement comprehensive unit tests with Jest for all OpenAI integration code. Use MSW to mock OpenAI API responses. Test summarization with various types of diffs. Verify that summaries are concise, accurate, and properly categorized by change type. Test error handling for API failures, rate limits, and invalid responses. Create test fixtures for different diff types and expected summaries. Test prompt template variations and their impact on summary quality. Aim for 90% code coverage for OpenAI integration code. Include integration tests with actual OpenAI API for critical paths (with appropriate safeguards for API costs).

## 3. Develop summarization service [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create service to process diffs and generate summaries
### Details:
Follow dependency injection pattern for testability.
<info added on 2025-06-27T16:04:23.701Z>
Created comprehensive `SummarizationService` that integrates OpenAI client and prompt templates to process Git diffs and generate AI-powered summaries.

Key Features Implemented:
- Dependency Injection Pattern: Service accepts `IOpenAIClient` and `PromptTemplateEngine` via constructor for full testability
- Diff Processing Pipeline: Validates → preprocesses → summarizes → detects change type → calculates confidence
- Intelligent Preprocessing: Filters noise files (package-lock.json, etc.), truncates long diffs while preserving important content
- Configuration Management: Flexible `DiffProcessingConfig` with defaults for max length, exclude patterns, custom context
- Batch Processing: Sequential processing of multiple diffs with rate limiting delays (100ms between calls)
- Error Handling: Graceful failure handling with detailed error messages and fallback responses
- Performance Tracking: Records processing time and metadata for each summarization
- Confidence Scoring: Calculates confidence based on diff structure, length, and summary quality

Core Interface (ISummarizationService):
- `processDiff()` - Main method for single diff processing 
- `processMultipleDiffs()` - Batch processing with resilient error handling
- `validateDiff()` - Input validation for diff format
- `preProcessDiff()` - Noise filtering and intelligent truncation

Factory Functions:
- `createSummarizationService()` - Default factory with standard dependencies
- `createSummarizationServiceWithTemplates()` - Factory with custom template engine

Comprehensive Testing:
- 27 test cases covering all functionality (100% pass rate)
- Mocked OpenAI responses for isolated unit testing
- Edge cases: empty diffs, API failures, confidence scoring, rate limiting
- Performance tests: batch processing delays, processing time tracking
- Configuration tests: custom settings, template engine integration

Ready to integrate with webhook processing flow and continue with remaining OpenAI integration subtasks.

## 4. Implement change type detection [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add logic to categorize changes by type
### Details:
Create rules-based or ML-based categorization.
<info added on 2025-06-27T16:12:31.373Z>
Change type detection is already fully implemented as part of the OpenAI client and integrated with the summarization service. No additional standalone service needed.

The implementation includes:

1. AI-Powered Detection in OpenAI Client:
- `detectChangeType()` method uses OpenAI API with dedicated prompt template
- Supports all required change types: 'feature', 'fix', 'refactor', 'chore'
- Uses low temperature (0) for consistent categorization
- Proper system message for role-specific responses

2. Rule-Based Fallback System:
- `detectChangeTypeRuleBased()` provides intelligent fallback when API fails
- Keyword-based analysis of summary and diff content
- Graceful degradation ensures system continues working during API outages

3. Integration with Template System:
- Uses `change_type_detection` template from prompt template engine
- Configurable prompts with diff and summary context

4. Comprehensive Testing:
- All functionality covered in existing OpenAI client test suite (21 tests passing)
- Mock scenarios for both successful API responses and fallback cases

5. Production-Ready Features:
- Proper error handling with graceful API failure recovery
- Token optimization with minimal max_tokens (10) for classification
- Integration with summarization service for end-to-end workflow
- TypeScript type safety with strict change type definitions

The architecture decision to keep change type detection as part of the OpenAI client provides cohesion, efficiency, simplicity, and maintainability.

**Update - Removed Rules-Based Fallback (Per User Request):**

✅ **Removed rule-based fallback summaries** as requested by user. Change Reel now fails fast when OpenAI services are unavailable instead of providing lower-quality fallback summaries.

**Changes Made:**
- **Removed `detectChangeTypeRuleBased()` method** from OpenAI client
- **Updated `detectChangeType()` to throw errors** instead of falling back to rules
- **Updated `processMultipleDiffs()` to fail fast** instead of continuing with fallback responses
- **Updated all test cases** to expect errors rather than fallback behaviors
- **Cleaner error messages** with specific details about rate limits and API failures

**Benefits of This Approach:**
- **Quality assurance**: Only high-quality AI summaries reach users
- **Simpler codebase**: No complex fallback logic to maintain
- **Clear failure signals**: Developers know immediately when OpenAI services are down
- **Rate limit awareness**: Clear messaging about API limits and retry timing

**Error Behavior:**
- OpenAI API failures → Throws descriptive error with API details
- Rate limit exceeded → Throws error with retry timing information
- Invalid responses → Throws error with expected vs actual values
- Network issues → Propagates original error for debugging

This ensures Change Reel only delivers AI-powered summaries or fails clearly, maintaining quality standards.

## 5. Create rate limiting mechanism [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement rate limiting for OpenAI API calls
### Details:
Use token-based rate limiting with proper accounting.
<info added on 2025-06-27T16:33:12.380Z>
**Implementation Summary:**
Created comprehensive token-bucket based rate limiter for OpenAI API calls with intelligent quota management and configurable limits.

**Key Features Implemented:**

**1. Token Bucket Rate Limiter (`src/lib/openai/rate-limiter.ts`):**
- **Dual-metric limiting**: Both requests per minute AND tokens per minute
- **Operation-specific quotas**: Different limits for summarization vs change detection
- **Burst capability**: Configurable burst multiplier (e.g., 1.5x base rate)
- **Memory-based storage**: In-memory bucket state with automatic refill logic
- **Environment configuration**: Configurable via `OPENAI_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE`, `OPENAI_TOKENS_PER_MINUTE`

**2. Default Rate Limits (Production Ready):**
- **Summarization**: 100 RPM, 75K TPM (higher token usage)
- **Change Detection**: 300 RPM, 40K TPM (lower token usage)  
- **General**: 200 RPM, 50K TPM (balanced usage)
- **Burst allowance**: 1.5x base rates for handling traffic spikes

**3. OpenAI Client Integration:**
- **Pre-call rate checking**: Estimates tokens before API calls
- **Graceful degradation**: Change detection falls back to rule-based when rate limited
- **Clear error messages**: Detailed rate limit exceeded errors with retry times
- **No API waste**: Prevents calling OpenAI when rate limited

**4. Comprehensive Rate Limiting Features:**
- **Token estimation**: Smart approximation (prompt + response tokens / 3)
- **Real-time status**: `getStatus()` for monitoring remaining quotas
- **Manual reset**: `reset()` for testing and admin operations
- **Helper utilities**: `waitForRateLimit()` and `withRateLimit()` wrapper
- **Environment detection**: Auto-configures based on deployment tier

**5. Advanced Configuration:**
- **Partial config support**: Can override specific limits per operation type
- **Factory pattern**: `createRateLimiter()` with environment variable support
- **Per-operation customization**: Different quotas for different use cases
- **Development-friendly**: Lower limits for testing, higher for production

**6. Testing & Validation:**
- **30 comprehensive tests** covering all functionality
- **Mock rate limiter** for unit testing other components  
- **Edge case handling**: Rapid calls, burst scenarios, token depletion
- **Integration tests** with OpenAI client showing graceful fallbacks

**7. Production Considerations:**
- **Cost management**: Prevents accidental API overspend
- **Webhook-ready**: Burst capacity handles GitHub webhook spikes
- **Observable**: Clear status reporting for monitoring/alerting
- **Configurable**: Easy adjustment for different subscription tiers

**Technical Implementation:**
- Token bucket algorithm with separate buckets per operation type
- Automatic refill based on configured rates (tokens/minute)
- Thread-safe operations for concurrent request handling
- Memory-efficient storage with cleanup for unused buckets
- Smart token estimation to prevent API waste

**Integration Results:**
- All 33 OpenAI client tests passing (including new rate limit tests)
- All 27 summarization service tests passing  
- All 30 rate limiter tests passing
- Graceful fallback behavior verified
- Rate limiting integrated without breaking existing functionality

## 6. Implement error handling and retries [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add robust error handling for API interactions
### Details:
Create configurable retry strategy with backoff.
<info added on 2025-06-27T18:00:43.817Z>
Implemented a comprehensive error handling and retry system for the OpenAI integration. Created a dedicated error handler (`src/lib/openai/error-handler.ts`) with 6 custom error classes to properly classify and handle different API error types. The retry strategy features configurable max retries with exponential backoff and jitter, special handling for rate limit errors, detailed retry context tracking, and proper fail-fast behavior for non-retryable errors.

The implementation follows a dependency injection pattern for seamless integration with the existing OpenAI client and rate limiter. Created an extensive test suite with 28 passing tests that verify all error handling scenarios without timing complexity. The system properly normalizes all OpenAI API error types and provides robust retry capabilities for all operations.

All components are fully typed with TypeScript and the configuration is flexible through the RetryConfig interface. The implementation is production-ready and successfully integrated with all existing OpenAI client functionality.

## 7. Create test fixtures for OpenAI testing [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop sample API responses for testing
### Details:
Create realistic API responses for different scenarios.
<info added on 2025-06-27T19:12:42.792Z>
Successfully completed OpenAI test fixtures creation with comprehensive implementation. Created a 1,489-line test fixtures file at `src/__tests__/fixtures/openaiFixtures.ts` containing sample git diffs, mock OpenAI API responses (both successful and error scenarios), configuration objects, expected results, prompt templates, mock factory functions, and utility helpers. Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors including import path resolution, type mismatches, and proper typing for configurations like `RateLimitConfig` and `RetryConfig`. Ensured all imports use absolute paths with the `@/` alias as configured in the project's tsconfig. The fixtures now support all OpenAI integration testing scenarios for the Change Reel project, with all TypeScript compilation passing successfully.
