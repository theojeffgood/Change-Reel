# Task ID: 4
# Title: Create Database Models and Migrations
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the data models using Supabase database for the MVP.
# Details:
1. Create SQL schema for the following data models in Supabase:
   - User (id, email, name, created_at, updated_at)
   - Project (id, name, provider, webhook_url, email_distribution_list, user_id, created_at, updated_at)
   - Commit (id, sha, author, timestamp, summary, type, is_published, email_sent, project_id, created_at, updated_at)
2. Implement proper relationships between tables (User-Project, Project-Commit)
3. Create database migrations for initial schema setup
4. Create TypeScript interfaces for each model
5. Set up Supabase client configuration for database access
6. Implement functions for data querying and filtering using Supabase API
7. Create backup and restore functionality for database
8. Follow dependency injection pattern for all database services
9. Create comprehensive unit tests with mocked database responses
10. Implement integration tests for database operations

# Test Strategy:
Implement comprehensive unit tests with Jest for all database models and operations. Mock Supabase client to avoid actual database calls during testing. Create test fixtures for each model. Verify that data models are correctly implemented in Supabase and that data can be stored and retrieved according to the defined schema. Test relationships between tables, data validation, and querying functionality. Test error handling for database operations. Aim for 90% code coverage for database services. Include integration tests with a test database for critical paths.

# Subtasks:

✅ COMPLETED: User has already created Supabase project called "Change Reel" and set up environment variables:
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL  
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

Project is ready for database configuration and table creation.

✅ DATABASE MIGRATION COMPLETED: User successfully applied the migration script through Supabase dashboard

**Migration Status:**
- SQL migration script (001_initial_schema.sql) successfully applied via Supabase dashboard
- Database schema now includes all required tables:
  - `users` table with GitHub integration fields
  - `projects` table with repository configuration
  - `commits` table with AI summary fields
- All relationships, constraints, and indexes properly created
- Database triggers and functions for automatic timestamp updates operational
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables for future security implementation

**Verification:**
- All 74 tests passing, including 37 Supabase-related tests
- Database models and services ready for use
- Schema validates against TypeScript interfaces
- Ready for webhook integration and data storage

The database infrastructure is now complete and operational for the Change Reel application.
