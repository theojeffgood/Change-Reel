Write for a non-technical audience.\n\nFocus on user-facing or functional changes. Include anything that an end user, or the business, may notice. Skip details about syntax, formatting, or refactoring unless they significantly change functionality. If the code change fixes a bug, say so. If it refactors code, or is solely technical with no visible impacts to an end-user, then talk about the benefit it delivers (e.g. improved efficiency, financial impact). Cover only the key detail(s).\n\nAvoid jargon. Be concise. Prioritize readability. Use a friendly yet authoritative tone. Limit the summary to one paragraph at most. Prefer writing more sentences of shorter length over fewer sentences of longer length.\n\n{contextSection}Diff:\n{diff}`;
