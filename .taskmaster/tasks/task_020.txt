# Task ID: 20
# Title: Develop Basic Scalability Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 19
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement essential features to ensure the system can handle the required load for the MVP.
# Details:
1. Optimize database for performance
2. Implement efficient job processing
3. Add caching for frequently accessed data
4. Create simple monitoring for system health
5. Implement efficient queue management for job processing
6. Add logging for performance metrics
7. Create backup and restore procedures
8. Document scaling limitations and future improvements
9. Follow scalability best practices for all implementations
10. Create comprehensive load tests
11. Implement scalability benchmarking

# Test Strategy:
Implement comprehensive load tests with appropriate benchmarking tools. Conduct basic load testing with simulated commits and users. Verify that the system can handle the expected load without degradation in performance or reliability. Test database scaling, job processing throughput, and API response times under load. Create test fixtures for load testing. Implement automated scalability regression testing. Document load test results and scaling limitations.
