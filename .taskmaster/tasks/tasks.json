Set up environment variables for OAuth credentials\n<info added on 2025-06-25T18:40:27.276Z>\n**OAUTH APP REGISTRATION STEPS:**\n\n1. **Go to GitHub Developer Settings:**\n   - Navigate to https://github.com/settings/applications/new\n   - Or go to Settings → Developer Settings → OAuth Apps → New OAuth App\n\n2. **Application Details to Register:**\n   - **Application name**: \"Change Reel - Git Commit Changelog\"\n   - **Homepage URL**: Will be the production domain (TBD, use localhost for now)\n   - **Authorization callback URL**: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/github/callback` (for development)\n   - **Application description**: \"Automated changelog generation from Git commits with AI-powered summaries\"\n\n3. **Required OAuth Scopes:**\n   - `repo` - Full access to repositories (needed for webhook creation and commit access)\n   - `write:repo_hook` - Write access to repository hooks (for webhook management)\n   - `user:email` - Access to user email (for notifications)\n\n4. **Environment Variables Needed:**\n   ```\n   GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here\n   GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here\n   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_random_secret_here\n   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000\n   ```\n\n**NEXT STEPS:**\n- Register the OAuth app with the above configuration\n- Note down the Client ID and Client Secret\n- Set up environment variables\n- Configure callback URL for production deployment later\n</info added on 2025-06-25T18:40:27.276Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-25T19:45:52.113Z>\n**CALLBACK URL CORRECTION**\n\n⚠️ **IMPORTANT URL PATTERN CORRECTION**\n\nThe callback URL pattern for NextAuth.js differs from what was initially configured:\n\n- ❌ **Incorrect pattern used**: `/api/auth/github/callback`\n- ✅ **Correct pattern required**: `/api/auth/callback/github`\n\n**Updated Authorization callback URLs:**\n- Development: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github`\n- Production: `https://yourdomain.com/api/auth/callback/github` (when ready)\n\n**Steps to fix:**\n1. Go to GitHub Developer Settings → OAuth Apps → Change Reel\n2. Edit the \"Authorization callback URL\" field\n3. Update to the correct pattern: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github`\n4. Save changes\n\nThis corrects the \"redirect_uri is not associated with this application\" error that occurs during OAuth flow.\n\n**NextAuth.js URL Structure Reference:**\n- Sign-in: `/api/auth/signin/github`\n- Callback: `/api/auth/callback/github`\n- Session: `/api/auth/session`\n</info added on 2025-06-25T19:45:52.113Z>",
