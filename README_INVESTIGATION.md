## üõ†Ô∏è The 3-Query Investigation

If you don't want to read anything, just run these 3 SQL queries:

### Query 1: Check Job Status (30 seconds)
```sql
SELECT id, type, status, error_message 
FROM jobs 
WHERE id = '9bff89b2-be1a-4e46-8853-f3872aa21507';
```
**Tells you:** Basic job status

### Query 2: Check Dependencies (30 seconds)
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as has_dependencies
FROM job_dependencies 
WHERE job_id = '9bff89b2-be1a-4e46-8853-f3872aa21507';
```
**Tells you:** If dependency exists (0 = missing)

### Query 3: Check Dependency Status (30 seconds)
```sql
SELECT j.id, j.type, j.status, j.error_message
FROM jobs j
JOIN job_dependencies jd ON jd.depends_on_job_id = j.id
WHERE jd.job_id = '9bff89b2-be1a-4e46-8853-f3872aa21507';
```
**Tells you:** Why the dependency might have failed

## ‚ú® Key Takeaways

1. **The Error:** `generate_summary` job can't find diff content
2. **The Cause:** `fetch_diff` job (dependency) either failed or didn't populate context
3. **The Fix:** Restart the `fetch_diff` job OR create the missing dependency relationship
4. **The Time:** 5 minutes to identify, 2 minutes to fix
5. **The Prevention:** Add better logging and validation to the job handlers

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate (Right Now)
1. Choose your investigation path above
2. Run the SQL queries for your path
3. Identify the root cause
4. Apply the appropriate fix

### Short Term (Next 24 hours)
1. Monitor job queue for similar errors
2. Check if the same commit now has a summary
3. Verify email notifications were sent (if applicable)

### Long Term (This Week)
1. Review DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md "Prevention" section
2. Add logging to track diff_content through jobs
3. Add alerts for missing diff_content errors
4. Consider adding fallback diff fetching
